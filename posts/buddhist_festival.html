        <h1 id="post-title">Buddhists Festivals in Nepal</h1>
        <p class="lead" id="author-date">23 Jun 2015 | Dipesh Chaudhary</p>

    <p>The culture of Nepal is synonymous with its festivals. Myriads of festivals pertaining to 
        different ethnic groups and religions are celebrated throughout the year. Nepal government, in the
        recent times, has declared national holidays for the chief festivals of major and minor tribal groups 
        of the country, which once was the privilege of those who
        celebrated Dashain, Tihar and other petty ‘exclusively’ Hindu observations.</p>
        <p>Buddhism is adhered by around 11% of the country’s population, especially by
            the highlanders (Sherpa, Bhotia), Tamangs , Gurungs and Buddhist Newars. These 4 
            different ethnic groups have their own specific festivals, dissimilar to other groups.
            The festivals observed by Sherpa and Bhotiya are almost , if not totally, similar to that
                of Tibetan while Newars, Gurungs and Tamangs have their own
            unique ways – some derived from the Hindu tradition and some passed down from generations.</p>
            <p><strong>Lhosar:</strong> Lhosar (New year in Tibetan) is the major religious day for Tibetan peoples, including 
                Sherpa, which marks the start of the new year. The festival usually falls during the month of February
                or March, which is decided according to the lunar calendar. The fête is actually celebrated for 15
                    days, first 3 days being the chief period of festivity. Donning new clothes, adorning with jewelries,
                    feasting and dancing are some of the features of the festival. Special noodles called “guthuk” are
                    prepared during Lhosar. In Baudhanath premises of Kathmandu, a portrait of Dalai Lama is exhibited 
                    and paraded around the shrine while a multitude of pilgrims swarm there. Tamangs celebrate Lhosar
                as “Sonam” Lhosar and Gurungs as “Tamu” Lhosar, but at separate times and diverse manners.</p>
                <p><strong>Buddha Jayanti</strong>: Buddha Jayanti which celebrates the birth of Lord Buddha falls on the day of the 
                    full moon of Baisakha (April or May). Some texts also claim that the Shakyamuni attained enlightenment 
                    and left his worldly soul on the same day. Major Buddhist shrines belonging to Tibetan Vajrayana sect are
                        embellished with prayer flags. Thousands of pilgrims, both Buddhist and Hindu, from all over Nepal as well as 
                        India throng Lumbini during this day. 
                    Amazing fact is that some Hindus also revere Buddha as the 9th reincarnation of lord Vishnu, though Buddha himself was an agnostic.</p>
                    <p><strong>Dalai Lama’s Birthday (June 6)</strong>: This anniversary is mainly celebrated by the Tibetan refugees dwelling around Baudhanath and 
                        different refugee camps of Nepal. Prayers are invoked for the long life and health of His Holiness. This day, apart from patriotic
                            significance, is
                            marked with religious importance as HH is considered to be the incarnation of Aalokitesvara, one of the bodhisattvas.</p>
                            <p><strong>Mani Rimdhu</strong>: This festival is observed by Sherpas in Khumbu (Everest region) of Nepal during the full moon of either December 
                                or November, which sometimes may be scheduled at a more specific time other than the mentioned months. The monks perform masked dances
                                celebrating the victory 
                                of Buddhism over Bon-Po religion in the region. This festival is also marked with merriment by monks as well as laymen.</p>
                                <p><strong>Yartung</strong>: Yartung means end of summer in Tibetan and is reveled in Ranipauwa, the gateway to Muktinath. Villagers from as far as
                                    Dolpo in the west gather to observe and participate in this 3 days carnival, usually feted during july, which also includes an 
                                    exciting horse race competition. The first day is royal day which features the (now-ex) 
                                    king of Mustang, second day is chiefly celebrated by the monks and third day is for the gala by the laymen (locals and tourists).</p>
